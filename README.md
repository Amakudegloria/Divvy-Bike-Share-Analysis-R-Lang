# Divvy Bike Share Analysis using R Language

### Udacity Data R programming Nano degree - project.

## Overview
In this project, I will explore data related to Divvy bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## What Software Do I Need?

To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

• Jupyter Notebook

• R studio

• A terminal application

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: 
Chicago, 
New York City, 
and Washington, DC.

### The datasets contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 which are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns: 

• Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57) 

• End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53) 

• Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776) 

• Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave) 

• End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave) 

• User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

### The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns: 

• Gender 

• Birth Year

### In this project, the code is written to provide the following information:

1. which month has the most bike usage?
2. On which particularly hour, day,week or month do we have the most users?
5. What is our most common start station?
6. What is the most frequent trip (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)?
7. What is the overall travel time so far?
8. What is the Average travel time so far?
9. What are the various User Types and their Trip Durations.
10. gender and age distribution of Users.


### The Files You will need the three city dataset files: 

• chicago.csv 

• new_york_city.csv

• washington.csv
